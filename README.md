## Tech Used
HTML5<br>
CSS3<br>
Javascript<br>
The Jamaican themed calculator was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript<br><br>
The HTML provided the basic structure, creating the layout for the calculator's buttons, display screen, and overall grid. <br><br>
CSS was then used to style the application, incorporating the vibrant colors of the Jamaican flag (green, yellow, and black) to give it a unique cultural touch.<br><br>
In JavaScript, I implemented the calculator's functionality by handling button clicks and performing mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). <br><br>
The logic behind the calculator was written to update the display dynamically based on user input and calculate results.<br><br>
